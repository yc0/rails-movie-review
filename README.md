 This applicatoin was inspired from Mackenziechild 12 in 12 challenge
 I followed his video learning rails.

 Here are some differences between Mackenziechild's version
- use **slim** instead of haml
- use **carrierwave** and **mini_magick** instead of paperclip
- some styles

### Version
none

### Tech
* [slim] - A lightweight templating engine
* [carrierwave] - This gem provides a simple and extremely flexible way to upload files from Ruby applications

### Installation

I use rvm with ruby 2.2.0 and rails 4.2.0. Because of spring, I need to use bin/bundle to make all extra cmds workable. I also exploit pow to start server. It is very convenient tool.

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] rails-movie-review
$ cd rails-movie-review
$ bin/bundle install
$ powder start
$ powder link
```

### Notes
None

### Dependencies
currently extended with the following plugins
* imagemagick


### Todo's
None
###License
